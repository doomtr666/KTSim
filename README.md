# Welcome to KTSim

A modest first attempt at applying Reinforcement Learning to a simplified version of the Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team board game rules.

- Features basic gameplay mechanics with minimal rendering using [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/).
- One opponent uses a random strategy, while the other leverages Reinforcement Learning.
- The best match is displayed in real time.
- This project is experimental and intended for learning and demonstration purposes.
